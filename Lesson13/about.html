                       <h3> The Beach City</h3>
                        <p>Welcome to Beach City! We are a local woman-owned smoothie and juice bar centrally located in Carlsbad Village just a few short blocks East of the Coast Highway and West of the I-5 on the corner of Carlsbad Village Drive and Roosevelt Street.</p>
                        <p>Serving Carlsbad Village for 13 years, we specialize in delicious and nutritious 100% vine ripened fruit smoothies, Acai and Pitaya bowls, fresh organic veggie juices, wheatgrass and ginger shots, gourmet soft traditional and stuffed pretzels and healthy grab n' go snacks and drinks.</p>
                       <p>Through the mid-20th century, when the U.S. population was smaller and the coast was still something of a frontier in many states, laissez-faire and absentee coastal landowners tolerated people crossing their beachfront property. Now, however, the coast has filled up. Property owners are much more inclined to seek to exclude an ever-growing population of beachgoers seeking access to less and less beach.</p>
                       <p>Early beach access laws in coastal states were largely designed to ensure that workaday activities such as fishing and gathering seaweed for fertilizer could occur, regardless of who owned the beach frontage. Increasingly, however, public recreation became the main use of beaches, and state laws evolved to recognize this shift.</p>
                        <p>The Carlsbad Village Association Board of Directors is an all-volunteer board made up of property owners, business owners, and residents in Carlsbad Village. These dedicated volunteers provide valuable oversight in guiding the organization, and are actively involved in planning and implementing projects designed to support the downtown businesses and Carlsbad Village as a whole. </p>
                        <p> Beach City! woman-owned smoothie and juice bar is among the Carlsbad Village Association businesses.</p>

        <h3>Beauty and Wonder; Above and Below</h3>
        <p>High ancient sea ledges, deep rocky canyons, flowering cactus, and desert wildlife—treasures above the ground in the Chihuahuan Desert. Hidden beneath the surface are more than 119 caves—formed when sulfuric acid dissolved limestone leaving behind caverns of all sizes.</p>
         <p>Carlsbad Caverns National Park is in the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico. It features more than 100 caves. The Natural Entrance is a path into the namesake Carlsbad Cavern. Stalactites cling to the roof of the Big Room, a huge underground chamber in the cavern. Walnut Canyon Desert Loop is a drive with desert views. Rattlesnake Springs, a desert wetland, attracts reptiles and hundreds of bird species.</p>
